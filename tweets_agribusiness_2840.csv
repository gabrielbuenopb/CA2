The average dairy farmer in Ireland is still farming approx 100 acres and most have grown since 2015 given it was their first chance to do so in 30 years given the artificial constraints in date until then.
@StuartMMeikle @ZwartblesIE @Env_Pillar @SCC_Ireland @swanireland Theres a balance between representing how it is and how it could be - the closest to future proofed farming is the straw no dig horticulture one with the person in it...however there are others similar available which don't use humour....
